public class Final
{
// final keyword can be used along with variable,methods and classes.
// final variable are nothing but constants, we cannot change the value of a final variable once it is initialized
// final method cannot be overridden which means even though a sub class can call the final method of parent class without any
// issues but it cannot be overridden.
// final class cannot be extended.

// final, finally and finalize are three different terms, finally is used in exception handling and finalize is a method that is called by JVM during garbage collection.
